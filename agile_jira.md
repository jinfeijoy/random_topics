## Agile

### Scrum Agile
* Process
    * Collect all the work that needs to be done
    * Put the work in the right order
    * Define checkpoints for completion of batches of work
        * Try to break tasks down into small enough fragments that you can reprioritize as often as you discover new things
        * A single agile task should take at least a few hours but no more than 3 days
        * Try making the maximum amount of time for a task 1 day
    * Then reprioritize at each checkpoint

* Tickets
    * Stories: are usually used by Prooduct Managers to describe planned work for a specific feature of a product       
    * Tasks: are typically used by any team members to describe other planned, non-story work
    * Bugs: can be used to explicitly call out unplanned work. This helps when you are working improve your overall quality
    * Epics: an epic is a collection of stories & tasks arranged together to achieve some specific, noteworthy outcome.

* Configure File
    * Adding story points: the story points field is useful when trying to estimate work during Scrum planning. (Configure_file->Where is my fild->Story Points) 
        * estimating use: 1,2,3,5,8,13
        * your smallest estimate ever should be 2-3 hours or 1 point
        * your biggest estimate ever should be 3 days or 13 points
        * new teams can use these two boundary points as a guide
    * Dividing the long list: Labels/Components can help
        * Labels: are just tags, users can make their own labels on-the-fly while editing a ticket
        * Components: are also tags, new components must be created by an administrator in Jira's settings section. 
    * The scrum backlog: in the scrum backlog, you prioritize your team's work and arrange it into two-week delivery batches called Sprints.    
    * Agile Sprints: 
        * A sprint has a start date and an end date
        * Sprints are often 2 weeks long
        * While a sprints is active, you shouldn't add new work to the active sprint
        * The name of Sprint can be use as letter + date (e.g. Sprint A: 2/12-2/24)
    * Epics: When creating Epics, avoid long-running/unfinishable epics like 'Maintenance' and 'Refactoring'
        * Epic is a container of issues

* Jira work flows:
    * all tasks in the project should go through all the steps of the workflow
    * users should be able to see all the columns of the workflow, so keep the number of steps to 7 or less.
    * make sure a single person on your team only needs to care about 1 project and 1 board in Jira at a time.

* Overall
    * Epics: an epic is a story that is too big for a single sprint, it's broken down into multiple user stories. When those are done, the epic is complete.

    * Issue/Projects: filds hold your data (example filds: description/summary/assignee/due date)
    * Projects: container for issues
