# Compare Different Dataset / Distribution Method

* [Z Test](http://homework.uoregon.edu/pub/class/es202/ztest.html)
* [KS Test](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-compare-two-distributions-in-practice-8c676904a285)
* [T Test](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/how-to-test-for-differences-between-samples.html): The t-test is used for continuous data to compare differences in means between two groups (either paired or unpaired).2 It is based on Student’s t-distribution (sometimes referred to as just the tdistribution). This distribution is particularly important when we wish to estimate the mean (or mean difference between groups) of a Normally distributed population but have only a small sample

  * Box-and-Whisker Plot
  * Histogram
  * Density Plot
  * Rug: simply draws ticks for each value, is another way to show distributions.
  * Violin Plot: The violin plot is like the lovechild between a density plot and a box-and-whisker plot. There’s a box-and-whisker in the center, and it’s surrounded by a centered density, which lets you see some of the variation.
  * Bean Plot: The bean plot takes it a bit further than the violin plot. It’s something of a combination of a box plot, density plot, and a rug in the middle.
