# [AI engineer roadmap](https://medium.com/data-science-collective/ai-engineering-a-realistic-roadmap-for-beginners-a2c8084c7c52)
* Build applications on top of pre-trained foundation models like GPT-4 or LLaMA
* Focus on model adaptation through prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and fine-tuning
* Prioritize scalability, evaluation, inference optimization, and real-world deployment
* Handle end-to-end systems including security, data handling, and user feedback

## First AI Project (2M)
* **Learn to use AI APIs** — Services like OpenAI’s API let you integrate powerful models without needing to build them yourself. This is the fastest way to start building real applications with AI capabilities.
* **Understand prompt engineering** — Learning how to effectively communicate with AI models is a crucial skill. Well-crafted prompts can dramatically improve model outputs and are essential for getting consistent results.
* **Build simple RAG applications** [example](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/chatgpt/rag-quickstart/azure/Azure_AI_Search_with_Azure_Functions_and_GPT_Actions_in_ChatGPT.ipynb) — This involves connecting AI models to your own data sources using vector databases and embedding techniques, so they can answer your queries more effectively.
* **Experiment with different pre-trained models** — Using resources like Hugging Face to access models others have created. This gives you experience with different model architectures without having to train or finetune them yourself.
* **Basic application architecture** — You’ll start learning how to structure AI applications with proper input handling, context construction, and output processing.

## Towards professional AI engineering
* Deep Learning — Understanding the intricacies of neural networks, training processes, and how foundation models work. Learn about transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, and how embeddings capture meaning.
* Deployment & Infrastructure — Learn containerization with Docker and cloud deployment on platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Understand system architecture, monitoring, and logging.
* Advanced RAG techniques — Implement more sophisticated document chunking strategies, optimize embedding techniques, and understand the tradeoffs between different retrieval methods.
* Working with foundation models — Mastering fine-tuning techniques like LoRA, and making intelligent model selection decisions based on tradeoffs between cost, performance, and licensing.
* Building robust evaluation systems — Creating systematic ways to test model performance, measure hallucinations and bias, and implement both automated and human evaluation processes.
* Inference optimization — Making models faster and more efficient to run through techniques like quantization, distillation, and optimized deployment architectures.
* Agent systems — Building AI applications that can break down complex tasks, use tools effectively, and maintain context over extended interactions.
* Security, privacy, and ethics — Implementing safeguards against attacks like prompt injection, ensuring privacy compliance, and considering the ethical implications of AI systems.
